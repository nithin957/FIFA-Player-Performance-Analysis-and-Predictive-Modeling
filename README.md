# FIFA-Player-Performance-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling
This project builds a player performance model using logistic regression and regularization techniques in R to predict player potential rating and wage classification.

In this project, extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted on a dataset comprising 18,483 FIFA player records. Through detailed analysis, key correlations and patterns were identified among player attributes, market values, and wages, with visualizations revealing insights into regional variations and player characteristics. Predictive modeling for player potential was developed using regularization techniques such as ridge regression and lasso regression, achieving a high R-squared of 98.86% on test data, where lasso effectively streamlined the model by eliminating less significant variables. Additionally, a logistic regression model was built to classify high-wage players, achieving 79.1% accuracy and an AUC of 0.873. The classification threshold was optimized to strike a balance between false positives and false negatives, enhancing the model's practical utility for talent scouting. Hypothesis testing comparing overall ratings between European and South American players highlighted statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05), offering valuable insights for regional scouting strategies. Various evaluation metrics including RMSE, R-squared, AUC, and ROC curves were employed to rigorously assess and compare model performances, ensuring robust and reliable predictions for player potential, market value estimation, and wage classification.
